IAM - 
Users and Policy Documents are:	
	Applied by Region
	Applied Globally
	Separated by Users = Regional, Policies = Globally <----- I like this one......WRONG
	Vice versa.
	
To assign permissions to a user, group, role or resource (4 types) - you create a Policy
A Policy is a document that explicitly lists permissions
	-Actions - what actions are allowed. Explicit allowing required 
	-Resources - what resources you are allowed the action on. Deny is default 
	-Effect - what the effect will be when the user requests access. Deny is default.
	
Policies are JSON documents

A Policy consists of one or more statements, and statements describe one set of permissions.

Resource-based policies must include a principal

Policy Validator - detect and correct invalid policies
Policy Generator - allows creation without accessing the console
